TODO:
* stylesheets/javascripts need to be cached as well
* fix caching hierarchy (e.g. layout should not be under a controller in
  ift.cache)
* improve README
* test with haml/sass
* ensure compatibility with merb-parts and merb-slices
* see if there is an alternative to alias_method_chain'ing #render and #display
* ift_ namespace is kinda lame - alternative?
* fix or find workaround for autotest infinite loops on first pass
